                    <p style="color:black;font-size: 20px;"><i> A hacker is a person skilled in <span style="color:blue;">information technology</span> who uses their technical knowledge to achieve a goal or overcome an obstacle, within a computerized system by non-standard means. Though the term hacker has become associated in <span style="color:blue;">popular culture</span> with a <span style="color:blue;">security hacker</span> &dash; someone who utilizes their technical know-how of <span style="color:blue;">bugs</span> or <span style="color:blue;">exploits</span> to break into computer systems and access data which would otherwise be inaccessible to them &dash; hacking can also be utilized by legitimate figures in legal situations. For example, <span style="color:blue;">law enforcement agencies</span> sometimes use hacking techniques in order to collect evidence on criminals and other malicious actors. This could include using anonymity tools &lbrace; such as a <span style="color:blue;">VPN</span>, or the <span style="color:blue;">dark web</span> to mask their identities online, posing as criminals themselves. Likewise, covert world agencies can employ hacking techniques in the legal conduct of their work. On the other hand, hacking and cyber-attacks are used extra- and illegally by law enforcement and security agencies (conducting warrantless activities), and employed by <span style="color:blue;">state actors</span> as a weapon of both legal and illegal warfare. </i></p>
