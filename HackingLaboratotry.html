                    <p style="color:black;font-size: 20px;"><i> A hacker is a person skilled in <span style="color:blue;">information technology</span> who uses their technical knowledge to achieve a goal or overcome an obstacle, within a computerized system by non-standard means. Though the term hacker has become associated in <span style="color:blue;">popular culture</span> with a <span style="color:blue;">security hacker</span> &dash; someone who utilizes their technical know-how of <span style="color:blue;">bugs</span> or <span style="color:blue;">exploits</span> to break into computer systems and access data which would otherwise be inaccessible to them &dash; hacking can also be utilized by legitimate figures in legal situations. For example, <span style="color:blue;">law enforcement agencies</span> sometimes use hacking techniques in order to collect evidence on criminals and other malicious actors. This could include using anonymity tools &LeftAngleBracket; such as a <span style="color:blue;">VPN</span>, or the <span style="color:blue;">dark web</span> &RightAngleBracket; to mask their identities online, posing as criminals themselves. Likewise, covert world agencies can employ hacking techniques in the legal conduct of their work. On the other hand, hacking and cyber-attacks are used extra- and illegally by law enforcement and security agencies (conducting warrantless activities), and employed by <span style="color:blue;">state actors</span> as a weapon of both legal and illegal warfare. </i></p>

                    <h3 style="color: black;font-size: 29px;"><i><b> General Definitions </b></i></h3>
                    <br/>
                    <p style="color:black;font-size: 20px;"><i> Reflecting the two types of hackers, there are two definitions of the word "hacker": </i></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li style="color:black;font-size:19px;"><i> Originally, hacker simply meant advanced computer technology enthusiast (both hardware and software) and adherent of programming subculture; see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_culture">hacking culture</a>. </i></li>
                        <li style="color:black;font-size:19px;"><i> Someone who is able to subvert <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security">computer security</a>.  If doing so for malicious purposes, the person can also be called a <span style="color:blue;">cracker</span>. </i></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p style="color: black;font-size:20px;"><i> Today, mainstream usage of "hacker" mostly refers to computer criminals, due to the mass media usage of the word since the 1990s. This includes what hacker slang calls &OpenCurlyQuote;<span style="color:blue;">script kiddies</span>&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; , people breaking into computers using programs written by others, with very little knowledge about the way they work. This usage has become so predominant that the general public is largely unaware that different meanings exist.  While the self-designation of hobbyists as hackers is generally acknowledged and accepted by computer security hackers, people from the programming subculture consider the computer intrusion related usage incorrect, and emphasize the difference between the two by calling security breakers &OpenCurlyDoubleQuote; crackers &CloseCurlyDoubleQuote;. </i></p>
                    <br/>
                    <p style="color:black;font-size:20px;"><i> The controversy is usually based on the assertion that the term originally meant someone messing about with something in a positive sense, that is, using playful cleverness to achieve a goal. But then, it is supposed, the meaning of the term shifted over the decades and came to refer to computer criminals. </i></p>
                    <br/>
                    <p style="color: black;font-size:20px;"><i> As the security-related usage has spread more widely, the original meaning has become less known. In popular usage and in the media, "computer intruders" or "computer criminals" is the exclusive meaning of the word today. &brace </i></p>
